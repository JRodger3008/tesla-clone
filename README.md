<strong>Task 17 - Introducing React Elements and Components - Part 3</strong>

This project was completed as a part of the DfE Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp at HyperionDev. My final grade for this was 94% along with my react-hello app, which will be within the react-hello repository.
<br>
Node modules have been deleted.

Further, you will find the comments recieved from a code reviewer at HyperionDev below, along with the grading.
<br>
I utilised the Prettier VSCode extention on this part, but, to the best of my knowledge, the comments made by the code reviewer are less applicable in this part compared to the react-hello app.

https://www.tesla.com/ - Original Website

<h3>Below is the task specifications for Part 3 as given by HyperionDev:</h3>

	‚óè Choose a website: Find a published web page that you particularly
	like, such as Netflix, Twitter, Instagram, Takealot, UCOOK, HyperionDev,
	or any other website that inspires you. Ensure that the website you
	choose is feasible to recreate within the scope of this task. Keep in
	mind that you are tasked to recreate a web page, not the entire
	website.
 
	‚óè Create a clone: Create a React application, using create-react-app,
	that serves as a clone of the chosen website. Don‚Äôt worry about adding
	state changes to your application.
 
	‚óè Functional components: Analyse the chosen website and identify its
	major components and sections. Implement functional components
	for different sections of the website, such as headers, navigation bars,
	content sections, and footers.
 
	‚óè Pass props: Choose at least one functional component to pass props
	to another applicable component. This will allow you to render specific
	information tailored to your webpage.
 
	‚óè Styling: Apply custom CSS rules and possibly Bootstrap components
	to style your website and make it visually similar to the original website.
 
	‚óè Link to website: Include the URL of the website you are recreating as a
	link at the bottom of your webpage, to provide a reference to the
	original source for comparison.

# Positive
Great work, Jordan! üëèüëèüëè

‚úÖ You have successfully implemented all of the requirements for this task.

‚ö°Ô∏è The reduce function for calculating the sub total and the use of props to make your components reusable are great examples of how you have displayed your skill in efficient coding.

üíØ Your use of meaningful variable names and excellent separation of concerns (separating assets and components) makes your codebase easy to navigate. The styling applied in both your apps is well thought out and does well to enhance the user experience.

üìù Your documentation is clear and helpful. Comments explaining the purpose of various sections and specific lines of code provide valuable context to the reader of your codebases.

<h4> SIDE NOTE </h4>
With regard to your comment about having the price as a number or a string, it is without a doubt better to store it as a number due to the exact reason that you mentioned: It makes it easier and simpler to modify if needed. You nailed it.


# Improve
STYLING
‚û°Ô∏è Unfortunately, you have used 'var' to declare some of your variables. For example. in line 86 of your Apps.js file of your react-hello app. Please make consistent use of 'let' (for variables that contain a value that changes throughout the code) and 'const' (for variables that don't change) when declaring your variables. Doing this will help ensure that you follow consistent and up-to-date recommended JavaScript practices.

‚û°Ô∏è Some of your code has not been formatted consistently for this task. For example, in lines 125 and 165 of the Apps.js file of your react-hello app, these lines should be indented to be in line with the start of the above line. Please remember that you can always install the extension 'Prettier' to format your code for you. This will save you a lot of time and increase your productivity by not having to worry about the indentation of your code. I'd highly recommend setting it to format on save. 

# Overall
Overall, great job, Jordan! Keep up the good work and consider the aspect of improvements in your future tasks or maintenance. I am confident that you will continue to excel as a developer. Happy coding! üöÄ
